## Bridge Architecture

Each bridge consists of:
- **Bridge Service**: The actual bridge application (e.g., mautrix-telegram)
- **Configuration UI**: A web interface for easy setup without CLI access
- **Persistent Storage**: Configurations and data stored in Docker volumes

## Development

### Adding a New Bridge

To add a new bridge to this repository:

1. Create a new directory: `matrix-bridges-[platform]`
2. Add required files:
   - `umbrel-app.yml` - App metadata
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Service definitions
   - `config-ui/` - Configuration UI application

### Structure Example
```
matrix-bridges-telegram/
â”œâ”€â”€ umbrel-app.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â””â”€â”€ config-ui/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ server.js
    â””â”€â”€ public/
        â””â”€â”€ index.html
```

## Configuration UI Features

Each bridge includes a custom web UI that provides:
- Easy credential input forms
- Status monitoring (config, registration, bridge status)
- Automatic configuration file generation
- Matrix homeserver integration
- User permission management

## Requirements

- Umbrel with Synapse (Matrix server) installed
- API credentials for the messaging platform you want to bridge
- Basic understanding of Matrix user IDs and domains

## Support

For bridge-specific support:
- **Telegram Bridge**: [#telegram:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#telegram:maunium.net)
- **General Matrix Help**: [#matrix:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org)

## ðŸ”§ GitHub Actions Setup

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish Docker images to GitHub Container Registry.

### Image Mirroring for Performance

**Why we mirror:** The upstream `dock.mau.dev` registry is very slow, causing Umbrel installations to hang or timeout. We mirror these images to GitHub Container Registry for 10x faster downloads.

**Mirrored images:**
- `dock.mau.dev/mautrix/telegram` â†’ `ghcr.io/posix4e/mautrix-telegram`
- Daily automatic updates via GitHub Actions
- Reduces installation time from 10+ minutes to under 1 minute

### Automatic Build Process

1. **On Fork**: GitHub Actions are automatically enabled
2. **On Push**: Images are built for multiple architectures (amd64, arm64, armv7)
3. **Daily Mirror**: Upstream images are pulled and re-pushed to ghcr.io
4. **Image Locations**: 
   - Config UI: `ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/telegram-bridge-config-ui:latest`
   - Mautrix Mirror: `ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/mautrix-telegram:v0.15.1`

### Customizing for Your Fork

After forking, the docker-compose.yml will automatically use your GitHub username for the image. If you need to customize:

1. Edit `matrix-bridges-telegram/docker-compose.yml`
2. Replace `posix4e` with your GitHub username in the image line
3. Push changes to trigger a new build

### Build Status

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To add a new bridge:
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new bridge following the structure above
3. Add a new build job in `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`
4. Test the bridge with Umbrel
5. Submit a pull request
